## Build Container Images for the Application

### Container 1: Backend Service (Go)

This image is built using a multi-stage¹ Dockerfile.  

_First Stage: Build_ 
Creates the first image.  Provides environment for compiling artefacts using build tools, 
such as source code, libraries. Outputs the binary file.

_Second Stage: Runtime_
Creates the final image to be used for running the backend. The minimal environment required
to run the backend.

### Manifests
_Backend Deployment:_
The backend deployment provides the blueprint for the backend pods. It will:
	- ensure 2 identical pods are running at all times 
	- provide resource limits to the container
	- inject env variables, config maps and secrets into container
	- define container's networking and service access
