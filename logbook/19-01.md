## Build Container Images for the Application

### Container 2: Frontend Service 
The frontend is written in plain HTML so a single stage build is sufficient.
If it was written using a framework -the way the backend used Go- a build stage
would be advisible in order to extract the artefacts to be used in runtime.

_nginx_
Serves the frontend application to the client.  Serves up the static files
which provides the homepage.  It is also assumes a load balancing role by 
sending any api requests to the backend. 

_nginx.conf_
Configures how nginx should behave when recieving requests.
